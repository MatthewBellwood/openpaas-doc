## Single sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is a property of _access control_ of multiple related, yet independent,
software systems. With this property, a user logs in with a _single ID_ and _password_ to gain
access to a connected system or systems without using different _usernames_ or _passwords_, or
in some configurations seamlessly sign on at each system. Have a look
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on).

OpenPaaS supports single sign-on(SSO) by external modules. Below is the list of SSO services
